### Exit Exam Practice 

**Directions:** The prompts in this practice exam are designed to gauge your facility with
_iteration_, _object and array access_, and _creating functions_, _implementing higher order functions_.

**Problem 1:** Create a function called `filterMeetingsByMonth` that takes in two parameters - `array` and `month`. The parameter `array` represents an array of meeting objects; `month` represents a string of a month. This function should use the native filter method to return a new array of only the meeting objects that take place in the given month.
